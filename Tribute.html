He is the younger brother of Zeref Dragneel, having originally died 400 years ago, being subsequently revived as his brother's most powerful Etherious: E.N.D. (ＥＮＤ Ī Enu Dī). Natsu is also among the five Dragon Slayers sent to the future from four hundred years past, having an additional purpose in the assistance of the defeat of Acnologia. </article>

    Natsu is a lean, muscular young man of average height with a slightly tan skin tone, black eyes, spiky pink-colored hair, and has abnormal sharp canines; Natsu has a scar on the right side of his neck, hidden by his scarf. Following his intense battle with the Rogue Cheney of the future, Natsu gains a cross-shaped scar on the left side of his abdomen, a result of the two fatal wounds the man dealt to him during their altercations. He later attains a new scar, this one being a jagged blemish on his right cheek, which he gained following his battle with Zeref. Natsu's guild mark is red and is located just below his right shoulder.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="tribute-info" >Natsu's main outfit consists of a sleeveless, gold trimmed, black waistcoat, often left open and untucked, exposing his bare chest, a gold trimmed, black cloth around his waist that reaches his knees, held by a leather brown belt with an oval-shaped silver buckle, white knee-length trousers with black ribbon ties, a thick black wristband on his left wrist,black open-toed sandals and the scale-patterned scarf he received from his adoptive father, Igneel. He has also been known to wear a rolled up comforter strapped across his back, though he rarely carries it in battle.</p>

                    In the year X792, Natsu is seen wearing a large, tattered, dark cloak with his trademark scarf. His pants are torn and patched and his arms and legs are wrapped in bandages. Later, he discards this outfit in favor of his old one, although he keeps the bandages on his right arm, which hide a draconian tattoo holding a portion of Igneel's power.Following the one-time use of Igneel's power, the tattoo disappears and Natsu abandons the bandages.

                    <b>Igneel's Magic Power:</b> Through ten months of dedicated training, Natsu became capable of accessing the residual, inert Magic Power of Igneel that was left within him. During this time a draconian tattoo appeared on his arm that served as the physical manifestation of the aforementioned Magic Power. The Magic Power bestowed to Natsu is said to be the manifestation of Igneel's undying will, however, it is extremely finite, and once it runs out, the user can never utilize its power again. </p>
                    <p id="tribute-info" >
                          <b>  Fire Dragon Slayer Magic (炎の滅竜魔法 Honō no Metsuryū Mahō):</b> Natsu is adept with his Dragon Slayer Magic and makes use of it in many different ways in combat.[43][44][45] As with all Dragon Slayers, he can consume his respective element, with the exception of that which he has created, to replenish his energy reserves. The heat of his fire can increase in temperature, which is proportional to Natsu's emotional state
                    </p>

                            <b>Dragon God's Brilliant Flame (竜神の煌炎 Ryūjin no Kōen):</b> An alternate version of Fire Dragon's Brilliant Flame, Natsu engulfs one hand in the flames from his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic, and the other in flames from Fire God Slayer Magic, and brings the two flames together, generating a highly destructive blast that is capable of destroying a large area, and defeating Zancrow, a member of the Seven Kin of Purgatory in one hit.[7

                         <b>   Lightning Fire Dragon Mode (モード雷炎竜 Mōdo Raienryū):</b> After eating Laxus Dreyar's lightning and having the flames and lightning inside his body fuse together, Natsu gained the ability to use his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic enhanced with lightning. When in a state of anger, Natsu is able to summon forth this power, however, it leaves him heavily exhausted afterward. After unlocking his Second Origin, Natsu experiences a noticeably less amount of strain.

                           <b> Black Fire Dragon Mode: </b>After absorbing the flames of Dark Regulus, Natsu is capable of combining these flames with their own for destructive effects. However, consumption of the flames of Dark Regulus rendered Natsu temporarily immobile, he soon recovered and became able to use the Dragon Mode at will.

                    <b>Igneel's Scarf:</b> It is a scarf given to Natsu by his foster father, which he always wears to remember him by.[15] The scarf is white, decorated with scale-like patterns, and serves as good-luck charm of sorts, warding off misfortune. When Natsu was hit by Zeref's Ankhseram Black Magic, the scarf served as his shield, but the exposure to the Magic caused it to turn black.[124] During the time it was tainted, Wendy was unable to heal Natsu, so, in order to heal him, she had to reverse and remove the evil spell on the scarf.</p>
                    <p><b> Flame Blade (封炎剣 Fūen Ken)</b>: When Natsu could not employ his Dragon Slayer Magic in Edolas, he fought using a Magic Item from Edolas that manifested its power as a destructive blade of flames. However, the blade's Magic was depleted after one use, due to Natsu's lack of skill with it and his habitual carelessness.

                          <b>  Heat Blade (ヒートブレード Hīto Burēdo):</b> When Natsu and Lisanna were imprisoned and unable to use their Magic within the Tartaros HQ, this sword fell on the ground near their cell and was used to cut off their chains and escape.
